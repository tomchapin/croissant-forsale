      <p>Dear Kerry,</p>
      <p>I hope you know that I think you're really <%= valentine.adjective_one %>. Just thinking about you makes me feel <%= valentine.adjective_two %> and <%= valentine.adjective_three %> inside.</p>
      <p> When we <%= valentine.verb %> together it makes me very <%= valentine.adjective_four %>. I think about you at least <%= valentine.number %> times a day. If it wasn't for your amazing <%= valentine.noun %> and <%= valentine.color %> hair I would be so <%= valentine.adjective_five %>. I am lucky to have a friend like you.</p>
      <p>Your <%=valentine.noun_two %> forever,</p>
      <p> <%= valentine.sender %> </p>
